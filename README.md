# N-body-Problems
Using Python to make simulations of N-body gravitational problems including galaxy collisions, three body scattering, and lagrange point movement. 

Refer to "Gravitational N-body Problems code.py" for our main code file, with "Gravitational N-body Problems - Report.pdf" being a summary of our work. 

My contributions to this project was all the galaxy collision code and animations that can be found in this repository, as well as adapting the numerical integration code framework and troubleshooting for the other scenarios.
